# Pattern Pal

**_A fiber artist and pattern designer's best friend! The goal of this project is to make creating custom pixel-based patterns fun and easy for fiber artists with a love of crochet and/or knitting ðŸ§¶._**

_Use our pattern-maker to create a custom grid-based design by hand, or import an existing grid to be converted to a pattern as-is- or customize it to your liking by making changes via the pattern-maker. Once you're happy with the way your design looks, save it to your account or share it with other crafters on Ravelry, Instagram, or Facebook!_
