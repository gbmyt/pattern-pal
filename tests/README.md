# Unit Test Todos

## A list of tests that still need to be implemented. This is not an exhaustive list

Regression Tests / Bug-Fixes

-   Redirects to the wrong route after sign-in with Clerk, even after dropping cache and re-starting the build. Confirmed all routes have been updated in the code base. Should be routing to '/editor' but instead goes to 'http://localhost:3000/pattern'
-   Delete user from the Clerk manage button should delete user in pattern pal database and all associated db charts.
